        "Tensor-Network Quantum Circuits {#tn_circuits}\n===============================\n\n::: {.meta}\n:property=\\\"og:description\\\": This demonstration explains how to\nsimulate tensor-network quantum circuits. :property=\\\"og:image\\\":\n<https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/thumbnail_tn_circuits.png>\n:::\n\n::: {.related}\ntutorial\\_variational\\_classifier Variational classifier\n:::\n\n*Authors: Diego Guala* ^1^ *, Esther Cruz-Rico* ^2^ *, Shaoming Zhang*\n^2^ *, Juan Miguel Arrazola* ^1^ *Last updated: 17 March 2022.*\n\n| ^1^ Xanadu, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C8, Canada\n| ^2^ BMW Group, Munich, Germany\n\nThis demonstration explains how to use PennyLane templates to design and\nimplement tensor-network quantum circuits as in Ref.. Tensor-network\nquantum circuits emulate the shape and connectivity of tensor networks\nsuch as matrix product states and tree tensor networks.\n\nWe begin with a short introduction to tensor networks and explain their\nrelationship to quantum circuits. Next, we illustrate how PennyLane\\'s\ntemplates make it easy to design, customize, and simulate these\ncircuits. Finally, we show how to use the circuits to learn to classify\nthe bars and stripes data set. This is a toy problem where the template\nlearns to recognize whether an image exhibits horizontal stripes or\nvertical bars.\n\nTensors and Tensor Networks\n---------------------------\n\nTensors are multi-dimensional arrays of numbers. Intuitively, they can\nbe interpreted as a generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices.\nTensors can be described by their rank, indices, and the dimension of\nthe indices. The rank is the number of indices in a tensor \\-\\-- a\nscalar has rank zero, a vector has rank one, and a matrix has rank two.\nThe dimension of an index is the number of values that index can take.\nFor example, a vector with three elements has one index that can take\nthree values. This is vector is therefore a rank one tensor and its\nindex has dimension three.\n\nTo define tensor networks, it is important to first understand tensor\ncontraction. Two or more tensors can be contracted by summing over\nrepeated indices. In diagrammatic notation, the repeated indices appear\nas lines connecting tensors, as in the figure below. We see two tensors\nof rank two connected by one repeated index, $k$. The dimension of the\nrepeated index is called the bond dimension.\n\n![image](../demonstrations/tn_circuits/simple_tn_color.PNG){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nThe contraction of the tensors above is equivalent to the standard\nmatrix multiplication formula and can be expressed as\n\n$$C_{ij} = \\sum_{k}A_{ik}B_{kj},$$\n\nwhere $C_{ij}$ denotes the entry for the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of\nthe product $C=AB$.\n\nA tensor network is a collection of tensors where a subset of all\nindices are contracted. As mentioned above, we can use diagrammatic\nnotation to specify which indices and tensors will be contracted\ntogether by connecting individual tensors with lines. Tensor networks\ncan represent complicated operations involving several tensors with many\nindices contracted in sophisticated patterns.\n\nTwo well-known tensor network architectures are matrix product states\n(MPS) and tree tensor networks (TTN). These follow specific patterns of\nconnections between tensors and can be extended to have many or few\nindices. Examples of these architectures with only a few tensors can be\nseen in the figure below. An MPS is shown on the left and a TTN on the\nright.\n\n![image](../demonstrations/tn_circuits/MPS_TTN_Color.PNG){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nThese tensor networks are commonly used to efficiently represent certain\nmany-body quantum states. Every quantum circuit can be represented as a\ntensor network, with the bond dimension dependent on the width and\nconnectivity of the circuit. Moreover, one can design quantum circuits\nthat have the same connectivity as well-known tensor networks like MPS\nand TTN. We call these **tensor-network quantum circuits**. Note that\nthe connectivity of a tensor network is related to how entanglement is\ndistributed and how correlations spread in the resulting tensor-network\nquantum circuit. We therefore design circuits based on the tensor\nnetworks that best capture the information we want to extract.\n\nIn tensor-network quantum circuits, the tensor network architecture acts\nas a guideline for the shape of the quantum circuit. More specifically,\nthe tensors in the tensor networks above are replaced with unitary\noperations to obtain quantum circuits, as illustrated in the figure\nbelow.\n\n![image](../demonstrations/tn_circuits/MPS_TTN_Circuit_Color.PNG){.align-center\nwidth=\"70.0%\"}\n\nSince the unitary operations $U_1$ to $U_3$ are in principle completely\ngeneral, it is not always clear how to implement them with a specific\ngate set. Instead, we can replace the unitary operations with\nvariational quantum circuits determined by a specific template of\nchoice. The PennyLane tensor network templates allow us to do precisely\nthis: implement tensor-network quantum circuits with user-defined\ncircuit ansatze as the unitary operations. In this sense, just as a\ntemplate is a strategy for arranging parametrized gates, tensor-network\nquantum circuits are strategies for structuring circuit templates. They\ncan therefore be interpreted as templates of templates, i.e., as\nmeta-templates.\n\nPennyLane Implementation \\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^ We now\ndemonstrate how to use PennyLane to build and simulate tensor-network\nquantum circuits.\n\nThe first step is to define the circuit that will be broadcast into the\ntensor network shape. We call this a block. The block defines a\nvariational quantum circuit that takes the position of tensors in the\nnetwork.\n"
