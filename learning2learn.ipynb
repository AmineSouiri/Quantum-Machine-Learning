Posted: 2 March\n2021. Last updated: 15 Sep 2021.*\n\nIn this demo we recreate the architecture proposed in *Learning to learn\nwith quantum neural networks via classical neural networks*, using\n**PennyLane** and **TensorFlow**. We use classical recurrent neural\nnetworks to assist the optimization of variational quantum algorithms.\n\nWe start with a brief theoretical overview explaining the problem and\nthe setup used to solve it. After that, we deep dive into the code to\nbuild a fully functioning model, ready to be further developed or\ncustomized for your own needs. Without further ado, let's begin!\n\nProblem: Optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecently, a big effort by the quantum computing community has been\ndevoted to the study of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) which\nleverage quantum circuits with fixed shape and tunable parameters. The\nidea is similar to classical neural networks, where the weights of the\nnetwork are optimized during training. Similarly, once the shape of the\nvariational quantum circuit is chosen --- something that is very\ndifficult and sensitive to the particular task at hand --- its tunable\nparameters are optimized iteratively by minimizing a cost (or loss)\nfunction, which measures how good the quantum algorithm is performing\n(see for a thorough overview on VQAs).\n\nA major challenge for VQAs relates to the optimization of tunable\nparameters, which was shown to be a very hard task, . Parameter\ninitialization plays a key role in this scenario, since initializing the\nparameters in the proximity of an optimal solution leads to faster\nconvergence and better results. Thus, a good initialization strategy is\ncrucial to promote the convergence of local optimizers to local extrema\nand to select reasonably good local minima. By local optimizer, we mean\na procedure that moves from one solution to another by small (local)\nchanges in parameter space. These are opposed to global search methods,\nwhich take into account large sections of parameter space to propose a\nnew solution.\n\nOne such strategy could come from the classical machine learning\nliterature.\n\nSolution: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBy building on results from the *meta-learning* literature in machine\nlearning, authors in propose to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as\na black-box controller to optimize the parameters of variational quantum\nalgorithms, as shown in the figure below. The cost function used is the\nexpectation value\n$\\langle H \\rangle_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\langle \\psi_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} | H | \\psi_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\rangle$\nof a Hamiltonian $H$ with respect to the parametrized state\n$|\\psi_\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\rangle$ evolved by applying the variational\nquantum circuit to the zero state $|00\\cdots0\\rangle$.\n\n![](../demonstrations/learning2learn/HybridLSTM.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"100.0%\"}\n\nGiven parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t-1}$ of the variational quantum\ncircuit, the cost function $y_{t-1}$, and the hidden state of the\nclassical network $\\boldsymbol{h}_{t-1}$ at the previous time step, the\nrecurrent neural network proposes a new guess for the parameters\n$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t$, which are then fed into the quantum computer to\nevaluate the cost function $y_t$. By repeating this cycle a few times,\nand by training the weights of the recurrent neural network to minimize\nthe loss function $y_t$, a good initialization heuristic is found for\nthe parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ of the variational quantum circuit.\n\nAt a given iteration, the RNN receives as input the previous cost\nfunction $y_t$ evaluated on the quantum computer, where $y_t$ is the\nestimate of $\\langle H\\rangle_{t}$, as well as the parameters\n$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t$ for which the variational circuit was evaluated.\nThe RNN at this time step also receives information stored in its\ninternal hidden state from the previous time step $\\boldsymbol{h}_t$.\nThe RNN itself has trainable parameters $\\phi$, and hence it applies the\nparametrized mapping:\n\n$$\\boldsymbol{h}_{t+1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} = \\text{RNN}_{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{h}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}, y_{t}),$$\n\nwhich generates a new suggestion for the variational parameters as well\nas a new internal state. Upon training the weights $\\phi$, the RNN\neventually learns a good heuristic to suggest optimal parameters for the\nquantum circuit.\n\nThus, by training on a dataset of graphs, the RNN can subsequently be\nused to provide suggestions for starting points on new graphs! We are\nnot directly optimizing the variational parameters of the quantum\ncircuit, but instead, we let the RNN figure out how to do that. In this\nsense, we are learning (training the RNN) how to learn (how to optimize\na variational quantum circuit).\n\n**VQAs in focus: QAOA for MaxCut**\n\nThere are multiple VQAs for which this hybrid training routine could be\nused, some of them directly analyzed in. In the following, we focus on\none such example, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)\nfor solving the MaxCut problem. Thus, referring to the picture above,\nthe shape of the variational circuit is the one dictated by the QAOA\nansatz, and such a quantum circuit is used to evaluate the cost\nHamiltonian $H$ of the MaxCut problem.

Then, a standard optimizer like the SGD\ncan be used to fine-tune the proposed parameters and reach even better\nsolutions. While on this small scale example the benefits of using an\nLSTM to initialize parameters may seem modest, on more complicated\ninstances and problems it can make a big difference, since, on random\ninitialization of the parameters, standard local optimizer may encounter\nproblems finding a good minimization direction (for further details,\nsee,).\n"

        "Final remarks\n=============\n\nIn this demo, we saw how to use a recurrent neural network as a\nblack-box optimizer to initialize the parameters in a variational\nquantum circuit close to an optimal solution. We connected MaxCut QAOA\nquantum circuits in PennyLane with an LSTM built with TensorFlow, and we\nused a custom hybrid training routine to optimize the whole network.\n\nSuch architecture proved itself to be a good candidate for the\ninitialization problem of Variational Quantum Algorithms, since it\nreaches good optimal solutions in very few iterations. Besides, the\narchitecture is quite general since the same machinery can be used for\ngraphs having a generic number of nodes (see \\\"Generalization\nPerformances\\\" in the Appendix).\n\n**What's next?**\n\nBut the story does not end here. There are multiple ways this work could\nbe improved. Here are a few:\n\n-   Use the proposed architecture for VQAs other than QAOA for MaxCut.\n    You can check the paper to get some inspiration.\n-   Scale up the simulation, using bigger graphs and longer recurrent\n    loops.\n-   While working correctly, the training routine is quite basic and it\n    could be improved for example by implementing batch learning or a\n    stopping criterion. Also, one could implement the *observed\n    improvement* loss function, as used in the original paper .\n-   Depending on the problem, you may wish to transform the functions\n    `rnn_iteration` and `recurrent_loop` to actual `Keras Layers` and\n    `Models`. This way, by compiling the model before the training takes\n    place, `TensorFlow` can create the computational graph of the model\n    and train more efficiently. You can find some ideas below to start\n    working on it.\n\nIf you\\'re interested, in the Appendix below you can find some more\ndetails and insights about this model. Go check it out!\n\nIf you have any doubt, or wish to discuss about the project don't\nhesitate to contact me, I'll be very happy to help you as much as I can\n\ud83d\ude01\n\nHave a great quantum day!\n"

        "Appendix\n========\n\nIn this appendix you can find further details about the Learning to\nLearn approach introduced in this tutorial.\n\nGeneralization performances\n---------------------------\n\nA very interesting feature of this model, is that it can be\nstraightforwardly applied to graphs having a different number of nodes.\nIn fact, until now our analysis focused only on graphs with the same\nnumber of nodes for ease of explanation, and there is no actual\nrestriction in this respect. The same machinery works fine for any\ngraph, since the number of QAOA parameters are only dependent on the\nnumber of layers in the ansatz, and not on the number of qubits (equal\nto the number of nodes in the graph) in the quantum circuit.\n\nThus, we might want to challenge our model to learn a good\ninitialization heuristic for a non-specific graph, with an arbitrary\nnumber of nodes. For this purpose, let's create a training dataset\ncontaining graphs with a different number of nodes $n$, taken in the\ninterval $n \\in [7,9]$ (that is, our dataset now contains graphs having\neither 7, 8 and 9 nodes).\n"
